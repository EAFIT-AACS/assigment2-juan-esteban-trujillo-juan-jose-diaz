# Assignment 2 - Pushdown Automata and Grammar Derivation

## Team Members
- Juan Esteban Trujillo
- Juan José Díaz

## System and Tools Used
- **Operating System**: Windows 11
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Tools**: Standard Python libraries

## Execution Instructions
To run the implementation, you must execute all the files available in the GitHub repository. The project consists of three main algorithms:

1. **Algorithm 1**: Generates valid strings based on a given grammar.
2. **Algorithm 2**: Implements a Pushdown Automaton (PDA) to validate and process the generated strings.
3. **Algorithm 3**: Computes the accepting configurations and leftmost derivations for the strings.

### Steps to Run the Code
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/EAFIT-AACS/assigment2-juan-esteban-trujillo-juan-jose-diaz.git
   cd assigment2-juan-esteban-trujillo-juan-jose-diaz
   ```
2. Ensure you have Python installed (preferably version 3.x).
3. Run the three algorithms sequentially:
   ```sh
   python ALGORITHM_1_LFCO_2025_JET_JJD.py
   python ALGORITHM_2_LFCO_2025_JET_JJD.py
   python ALGORITHM_3_LFCO_2025_JET_JJD.py
   ```

Each script must be executed in order to generate and validate the grammar-based strings successfully.

If you encounter any issues, verify that all necessary files are in the same directory and that you are running the scripts in the correct sequence.
